# Changelog

This changelog tracks the fork release version for vLLM Tesla T10 Definitive
Edition. It is separate from the upstream vLLM package version.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-06-17

- Retargets the fork from dual RTX 2080 Ti 22GB to multi Tesla T10 16GB / SM75
  serving with flexible tensor parallel size (TP=2/4/8).
- Updates `launcher.sh` GPU detection: default `TARGET_GPU_PATTERN=t10`, selects
  all matching Tesla T10 cards, and enforces `TP_SIZE == GPU_DEVICES` count.
- Updates `build.sh` preflight for Tesla T10 name matching and 16GB VRAM
  thresholds.
- Adds experimental Tesla T10 profiles under `profiles/qwen27b/tp2/` and
  `profiles/qwen27b/tp4/` plus sweep documentation in
  `docs/qwen36-kv-throughput-sweep-t10.md`.
- Preserves legacy dual 2080 Ti validated profiles under
  `profiles/qwen27b/normal/...` as historical benchmark evidence.
- Runtime identity becomes `vllm-sm75-tesla-t10-cu128`; CUDA arch remains
  `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=7.5`.

## v0.1.9 - 2026-06-15

- Restores the validated Qwen3.6 27B FP8 + TurboQuant TQK8V4 `fast` route on
  SM75 by pinning the working FlashInfer 0.6.8 runtime path and guarding
  unvalidated newer FlashInfer ragged-prefill behavior.
- Adds TurboQuant launcher defaults for the validated FlashInfer `fa2` prefill,
  workspace reservation, and speculative decode fast path used by the tested
  dual 2080 Ti route.
- Carries FlashQLA legacy SM70/SM75 patch assets into source builds so fresh
  builds reproduce the validated GDN prefill path.
- Improves one-click build reliability with network preflight, package/git
  mirror fallback, local wheelhouse support, CUDA toolkit sanity checks, and
  clearer hardware/environment hints.
- Adds `update.sh` for release-version checks and optional rebuild after an
  update.
- Documents the recommended host runtime as Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 LTS or Debian
  12 on Linux kernel 6.x. Ubuntu 26.04 / CUDA 13 remains a community
  experiment until runtime profiles are validated.

## v0.1.8 - 2026-06-14

- Improves source-build reliability for non-Miniclaw dual 2080 Ti hosts,
  including automatic FlashQLA SM70/SM75 install and clearer runtime path logs.
- Fixes local launch reliability around service stop, failed-start cleanup,
  generated-kernel cache isolation, and default `normal` mode handling.
- Adds an explicit `aggressive` launcher mode: a more aggressive mode with the
  highest performance and quality risk.
- Tightens SM75 backend selection so Turing hosts do not accidentally prefer
  unsuitable FlashAttention paths over the validated FlashInfer/TurboQuant
  routes.
- Carries the SM75 TurboQuant compatibility fixes for workspace reservation,
  sliding-window decode, and legacy runtime environment handling.
- Refines Qwen GDN / linear-attention decode correctness and removes debug-only
  overhead from the normal serving path.
- Updates hardware notes for CPU/platform latency after local build-to-launch
  validation showed old Xeon hosts can underperform newer low-end desktop CPUs.

## v0.1.7 - 2026-06-13

- Updates the `safe`, `normal`, and `fast` launch modes. `normal` is now the
  default recommended mode.
- Fix OpenAI-compatible tool calling, including automatic tool choice and
  structured tool-call output.
- Fixes SM75 TurboQuant compatibility gaps reported against the legacy
  `fast` + INT8-KV route: all ubatch workspace reservation, decode
  `sliding_window` handling, and fork-specific runtime environment variables.
- Improves the current Qwen and Gemma serving routes with updated stability,
  long-context, and profile validation work.
- Includes the Gemma4 checkpoint-name remap fix for official QAT and
  multimodal-style checkpoints.


## v0.1.6 - 2026-06-09

- Adds explicit W8A8 checkpoint support documentation for the Quark INT8 route,
  including the tested `nameistoken/Qwen3.6-27B-Quark-W8A8-INT8` checkpoint.
- Updates the launcher display to separate the real vLLM `--quantization`
  value from the display-only W/A type (`W4A16`, `W8A16`, `W8A8`).
- Adds launcher service-status cache reporting for running services. Live
  `used` values and 30-second refresh are shown only when vLLM exposes real
  cache-usage metrics; otherwise the launcher reports total cache capacity only.
- Improves launcher startup preflight for large single-file checkpoints and
  cleans up residual vLLM processes after failed launches.
- Fixes launcher stop handling so orphaned vLLM API servers, worker processes,
  and resource trackers are discovered and cleaned up instead of leaving VRAM
  occupied.

## v0.1.5 - 2026-06-08

- Renames the public service manager to `launcher.sh` and keeps `build.sh` as
  the one-click source build entry point.
- Updates launcher modes to `safe`, `normal`, and `fast`, with route profiles
  split by model, mode, and weight precision.
- Adds chat template presets and service-level thinking budget defaults while
  keeping global runtime controls out of route profile files.
- Refreshes the Qwen3.6 profile documentation and restores the KV throughput
  sweep SVG charts.

## v0.1.4 - 2026-06-06

- Slims the public repository down to the focused SM75 runtime source tree,
  launcher scripts, validated profiles, and project documentation.
- Keeps Docker artifacts out of this source release; Docker packaging remains a
  separate future deployment layer.
- Adds the interactive `launcher.sh` service manager and one-click `build.sh`
  source build entry point.
- Uses the public launcher modes `safe`, `normal`, and `fast`, with validated
  profiles organized under model-specific profile directories.
- Carries forward the `v0.1.3` graph-safety runtime fixes while removing
  upstream CI/docs/test bulk from the public source tree.

## v0.1.3 - 2026-06-05

- Adds the issue #24 MTP graph-safety fix for hybrid Mamba/GDN models.
- Makes production profiles safer by default: Native MTP + hybrid recurrent KV
  layers fall back from full decode CUDA Graph replay to PIECEWISE/NONE.
- Keeps the old peak-throughput route available for explicit speed benchmarking
  via `VLLM_ALLOW_MAMBA_SPEC_FULL_CUDAGRAPH=1`.

## v0.1.2 - 2026-06-04

- Public stable snapshot for the SM75 TP=2 CUDA 12.8 runtime.
- Keeps the upstream vLLM base at `0.21.0` while versioning this fork as an
  independent 2080 Ti runtime distribution.
- Updates the documented Qwen3.6 and Gemma4 runtime routes, tested checkpoint
  list, launcher profile guidance, and benchmark evidence links.

## v0.1.1

- Follow-up compatibility fixes for editable/source builds and optional CUDA
  extension imports on SM75 environments.

## v0.1.0

- Initial public stable snapshot of the dual 2080 Ti / SM75 TP=2 runtime.
